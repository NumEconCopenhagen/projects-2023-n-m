This repository contains  
1. Inaugural project. 
2. Data project. We fetch data from **Danmarks Statistikbank** on **the divorce rate, and the wages for men and women in Denmark** and show that an increase in women's wages decreases the divorce rate, whereas an increase in men's wages increases the divorce rate.
3. Model project. We model a Solow model with human capital. We extend the model by exploring a change in savings rates.
